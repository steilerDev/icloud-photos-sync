# WebUI

## Basic WebUI

A basic UI is available on the port that is passed via the `port` parameter or 80 by default. Naturally it only is available as long as the app is running. This makes it most useful for daemon mode, but it can just as well be used for MFA Input when running a regular 'sync' or 'token' job. The UI provides the following features:

- **Sync Status** Showing in which state the app currently is. Most of the times this will show wether the last sync was successful or not. If the app is running in daemon mode, the UI will also show the next scheduled sync time.
- **Manual Sync Trigger** You can trigger a manual sync by clicking the "Sync Now" button. This will start a new sync process and show the progress in the UI.
- **Manual Reauthorization** If the last sync failed because the MFA token expired, you can reauthorize the app by clicking the "Reauthorize" button, which will start a new authorization process (basically the same as what the 'token' job does). If you have `failOnMfa` set, this is ignored when the reauthorization is triggered through the UI.
- **MFA Code Input** If the app is waiting for an MFA code, you can enter it in the UI. This cannot only be done when the app
- **Resend MFA Code/Change MFA Method** By default, MFA codes will be send to a device. However, if you want to receive your code using sms or a call, you can do so by clicking the 'Resend Code/Change Method' button in the view to submit the MFA Code.

The UI is only available in Englisch, although the sync timestamps use the formatting of the system locale.

## Watching the synced Photos

Since this tool is syncing all assets to the native file system, pretty much any tool can be used to present the pictures. I've been testing some tools recommended by [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#photo-and-video-galleries) and settled on [Photoview](https://photoview.github.io/). The following `docker-compose.yml` will run `icloud-photos-sync` together with `Photoview`:

```
